ExtraLargeArray: insert is 772.537792 miliseconds and append is 2.349167 miliseconds. Append is the faster time. 

LargeArray: insert is 6.489542 miliseconds and append is 450.042 miliseconds. insert is faster.

MediumArray: insert is 161.208 microseconds and append is 124.208 microseconds. append is faster

SmallArray: insert is 22.375 microseconds and append is 45.042 microseconds. insert is faster.

TinyArray: insert is 19.75 microseconds and append is 54.667 microseconds. insert is faster. 


The append is slower when the array is small. As it gets bigger the append becomes faster. the append scale is O(n) and the insert scale is O(n^2). the appen scale is better.
